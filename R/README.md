# R
Some R sample code.

## What is it?
1. `BinaryIO`: a small example of reading binary data I/O.
1. `Conda`: how to manage R distributions using conda.
1. `Rmpi`: very simple example of using the `Rmpi` library, mostly useful
    to verify whether `Rmpi` is installed correctly.
1. `RscriptWorker`: a simple R script that can (and should) be run from
    the command line using Rscript.  It also illustrate on how to run
    this in a parameter exploration scenario using the worker framework
    to perform such computations in parallel with minimal effort for
    the user.
1. `CfromR`: illustration of using C functions from R.
