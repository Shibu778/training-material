# Humanize

Implementation of a function that converts a floating point number
to a "human-readable" format, e.g., `1234.5' would be rendered as
`1.2 K`.  The function has options to use base 2 rather than base
10, and to add units.

The "inverse" function is also implemented (`dehmanize`).

## What is it?

1. `humanize.py`: can be used as a module or as an application for
   demo purposes.
1. `dehumanize.py`: can be used as a module or as an application for
   demo purposes.
