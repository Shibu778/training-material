# Optimization
Needless to say that optimization is a rather important topic in HPC.

A collection of code samples that illustrate opportunities for code
optimization, or highlight potential performance bottlenecks.

This section of the repository has been superceeded by a
training repository on code optimization.

## What is it?
1. `Branching`: branching instructions can decrease performance.
1. `Fdo`: small illustration of using FDO (Feedback Directed Optimization).
1. `GalleryProcessorCacheEffects`: C implementations of the code examples
    given in Igor Ostrovsky's interesting blog post on effects the various
    caching mechanisms in a modern CPU can have on performance.  See the
    following URL for his original post:

1. `hpc_efficiency.pptx`: slides on a number of aspects related to
    efficiency in HPC.  Scaling is discussed, as well as various aspects
    of hardware properties that influence performance.
